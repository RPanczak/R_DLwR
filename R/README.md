## Deep Learning with R, 2nd Edition (Code Only)

The repository contains just the code from the book "Deep Learning with R, 2nd Edition".

Note that the code examples currently require the development versions of the reticulate, keras, tensorflow, and tfautoraph packages.
You can install all the dependencies by running this R script at the terminal:

```bash
Rscript install-dev-r-tensorflow.R
```

Note: the install script assumes that R and CUDA drivers are already installed.
